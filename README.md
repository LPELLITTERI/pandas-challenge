#Analysis

###Based on the available data, charter schools tend to have smaller school sizes and budgets compared to district schools. However, charter schools generally have higher test scores in reading and math. It is important to note that there are many factors that can influence test scores, and the relationship between school size, budget, and test scores is complex. There is a direct corelation between school size and positive test scores across the board. Smaller schools perform better.
